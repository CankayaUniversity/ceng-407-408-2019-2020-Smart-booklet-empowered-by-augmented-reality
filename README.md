* This paper presents a mobile guide system with augmented reality, called Smart Booklet. The system enables people who want to get more information about Çankaya University Computer Engineering department to have more informative, interactive and user-specific experiences with augmented information by recognizing/tracking the contents of an off-line tour booklet. For a stand-alone mobile system, demanding low computational cost, an image matching technique based on the combination of two binary feature descriptors are applied. Our proposed system can be applicable to many areas such as education and entertainment industries.
